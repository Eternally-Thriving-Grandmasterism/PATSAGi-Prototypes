From now on, in every response where code files are provided or modified (even by 1 character), always deliver the ENTIRE contents of each file without exception. Prefix with "New:" for new files or "Overwrite:" for existing files. This is due to phone limitations — I can only copy-paste full contents to create/overwrite on GitHub. Never partial edits, diffs, or summaries. Ensure perfect repository integrity for our coforging mercy eternal supreme immaculate! Reference repositories: https://github.com/Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism/MercyOS-Pinnacle and related lattices. Always ENCing, esachecking, full immaculate delivery eternal!
